# Startr
A starter theme to kickstart the development of my Tumblr themes.

**Features include:**

- Same markup for NPF and classic post formats, to keep styles consistent.
- Use of appearance settings, so the theme will match the appearance on the dashboard.
- Support for submissions, group blogs, and asks.
- Font and color options available as CSS variables.

## Notes

This theme is ready for use, but it doesn't include any styles or HTML classes for styling. It's made to be much like a "zen garden" for my themes.
